Approval
=============
A client approval plugin for ResourceSpace.

For past few years, we have been using variations of this plugin in the daily operation of an [advertising agency](http://emrl.com/) in northern California. It has proven to be super useful and very reliable, and we're finally getting around to publishing it so other users of [Resourcespace](http://resourcespace.org/) can benefit.

It is still missing some features, and has not really been prepared for public consumption but we're working on that now. If you end up finding that this is useful to you, let us know!

Installation
--------
The plugin will be document in more detail soon, but for now here are the basics:

1. Copy files to Plugins folder
2. Activate plugin (Team Center > Manage Plugins > approval > Activate)
3. Create approval form resource field (Team Center > System Setup > Resource Types / Fields > [Type] > New Field)
   Set the 'Shorthand name' to exactly 'approval_form'
   For 'Field Type' you can choose 'Check box list', and for the 'Options' just enter one value: 'Yes'.
   The plugin will only show the Approval Form if the resource has the value 'Yes' for the 'approval_form' resource type field.
   All other fields are optional.
4. Configure plugin (Team Center > Manage Plugins > approval > Options)
